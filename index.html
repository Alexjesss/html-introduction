    <h5> Funny story</h5>
    <p> I once had a goldfish named Gigi. He lived for quite some years. And i always had the feeling that he was very happy to see me when i came home from school.
        This goldfish was special because he not only ate fishfood he also ate the foods i gave him. Like cheese, pieces of meatballs, cereal etc.
        But sadly, all wholesome stories come to an end and one day Gigi died. I actually cried. </p>
    <h6>TL;DR</h6>
    <p>My goldfish Gigi not only ate fishfood but also humanfood and then it died (from old goldfish age).</p>
