<h5> Funny story</h5>
<p> I once had a goldfish named Gigi. He lived for quite some years. And i always had the feeling that he was very happy to see me when i came home from school.
    This goldfish was special because he not only ate fishfood he also ate the foods i gave him. Like cheese, pieces of meatballs, cereal etc.
    But sadly, all wholesome stories come to an end and one day Gigi died. I actually cried. </p>
<h6>TL;DR</h6>
<p>My goldfish Gigi not only ate fishfood but also humanfood and then it died (from old goldfish age).</p>
